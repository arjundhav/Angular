      //Hoisting:In JS,variable can be declared after it has been used.It can be used before it has been declared.
      //Hoisting is a JS mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.
      //Inevitably, this means that no matter where functions and variables are declared, they are moved to the top of their scope regardless of whether their scope is global or local.

      //Example:

      carName = "Volvo";
      //const carName;
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = carName;

      /* try {
        carName = "Saab";
        let carName = "Volvo";
      } catch (err) {
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = err;
      }
    */

      var x; // Declare x
      x = 5; // Assign 5 to x

      elem = document.getElementById("demo"); // Find an element
      elem.innerHTML = x; // Display x in the element
